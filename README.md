# YoloV3.ONNXRuntime
Library to run YOLOV3 onnx models with [onnxruntime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) and [skiasharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp).

Pretrained model available at https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/master/vision/object_detection_segmentation/yolov3/model/yolov3-10.onnx

## Known issues / remaining tasks
1. bounding boxes are not accurate
2. return boxes from library


## Roadmap
- Finsish library
- Create Xamarin.Forms control running real-time YOLOv3 detection across devices using same onnx-model
